##Introduction

Readiac is an online book store that was built by following the book "Agile Web Development with Rails, Fourth Edition". It is a work in progress that receives upgrades as I learn new Ruby/Rails concepts, some of which are the optional enhancements/exercises at the end of each section in the book, and the rest are my own enhancements which I did to further reinforce knowledge learned in the book and online.

I'd like to eventually drop the academically-driven ecommerce aspect of it and turn it into a sort of book review aggregator from various sites and have it make suggestions.
